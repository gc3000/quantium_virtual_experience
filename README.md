Quantium Virtual Experience Project

You are part of Quantium’s retail analytics team and have been approached by your client, the Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.
The insights from your analysis will feed into the supermarket’s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.
